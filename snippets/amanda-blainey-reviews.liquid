  <blockquote>&lsquo;This is the book I wish I had already read. This is a book we all should read - <em>must</em> read. It should be dropped with the milk bottles on the doorstep in the morning; be found wrapped in the daily newspaper; be given as a birth present to every infant, and set as a GCSE text. Clear, concise, practical and kind. For both the person facing - and those helping - in this moment of life that we will all confront. Beautiful work.&rsquo;</blockquote>
