<p>From a life of 'doing' in the world of advertising to a life of 'being' as a yoga and mindfulness teacher, Michael Townsend Williams now works on the integration of both. His business, <a href="http://www.stillworks.org">Stillworks</a>, coaches individuals, teams and organisations on Mindful Productivity and Mindfulness. He is also co-creator of the iPhone app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/breathe-sync/id722304193?mt=8&utm_content=bufferac0af&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">BreatheSync</a>, which brings your breathing into sync with your heart to reduce stress and improve focus. He believes the world needs to calm down and we would all get a lot more done if we did.</p>
