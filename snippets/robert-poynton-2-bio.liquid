Robert Poynton lives in an off-grid, solar-powered house just outside the small town of Arenas de San Pedro in rural Spain. By way of contrast, he also spends a significant amount of time in Oxford, where he is an Associate Fellow of the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford. His work there is practical not academic — he designs and runs executive education programmes, helping senior leaders understand and work with complex change, via a playful approach developed from improvisational theatre. Many of his friends regard his entire career as one long pause. He is also the author of <i>Do Improvise</i> (Do Books, 2013).
