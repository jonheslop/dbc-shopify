<p>David Hieatt is not a theorist. He has built brands from nothing, with next to nothing, just by understanding a few basic rules. The ‘Scrapbook Chronicles’ newsletter has become a cult offering from his company, the Hiut Denim Co. Its open rate exceeds almost any industry standard. It is one of those rare newsletters that people actually look forward to receiving. Hiut Denim regularly receive gifts through the post thanking them for sending it out. And it has delivered results. It has grown the company by 25 per cent each year for the last three years. And each year for the last three years, the company has turned a profit. <p>He is the co-founder of The Do Lectures and has spoken at Apple, Google and Red Bull, amongst others. In 2010 he self-published <i>The Path of a Doer</i> and in 2014 he published <i>Do Purpose: Why brands with a purpose do better and matter more</i> (Do Books).</p>
