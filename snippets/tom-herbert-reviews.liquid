  <blockquote>&lsquo;Tom is one of the most generous and soulful cooks I have ever met. He makes cooking dinner outside on a fire, or baking amazing bread, seem natural, seamless and most of all easy. Simple ingredients become incredible family meals. Tom's cooking is inclusive, inspired, spirited and downright delicious. I’ll be cooking from this book for years. I can't wait to get outside and try them.&rsquo;</blockquote>
